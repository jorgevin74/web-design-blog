<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration:</h2>
<p>I haven't looked at many projects but I remember one project that I really liked was the more simplistic Bront.Rodeo blog. Something about the simple black and gray fonts, the nav bar, the way they have the date and title all laid out so it is easy to see is what I enjoyed and it is something that caught my eye when we first looked at it during class last week.</p>
<p>I kept thinking of different aesthetics when looking up the web page, some terms I found was casual or business casual, I think in one other direction I had some sort of spring colors, something bright and lively and another would be some sort of retro aesthetic with bright neon or dark colors.</p>
<h2 id="sketches">Sketches:</h2>
<p>Here's a figma screenshot of the page below where I planned out how I would want the nav bar to be organized.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TK0ZZh_mwr0QfFEMXx86XlNiacYD64YAEfzCf7fUWIg/edit?usp=sharing">Sketches / Wireframes</a></p>
<p>Eventually I detailed different layouts of how the post page should look like and how it would work.</p>
<p>I also created many different sketches to see how different versions of my page looked like and how I wanted the date, the tags and the possible description included in it would look like.</p>
<p>(I included it in a google docs / drive link due to the img tag not working)</p>
<h2 id="technical-process">Technical Process:</h2>
<p>I experimented with the nav bar, I orginally wanted to play around and have the &quot;Home About&quot; navigation area onto the left hand side and move the title to the right hand side although I wasn't a huge fan of it. I ended up going with the more experimental nav bar and having it on the side while going up and down on the web page.</p>
<p>I think what was difficult to understand was what goes on with the uses of &quot;percent sign&quot; and &quot;curly braces&quot; although over time I understood how the curly braces were utilzied but the other stuff like tags, not so much.</p>
<p>I didn't expect the nav bar on the side to work so well, in my opinion, I originally had this idea from a portfolio page I was working on recently but haven't had time to finish it and was unpolished but now with this it gave me an opportunity to polish and get everything right this time around.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources:</h2>
Since I got the idea for the nav bar a while ago I can't remember the exact youtube video, but all I remember what I searched to look up for it was like "cool site desgins" or just "site designs" in general and I scrolled through the list of videos and clicked on one and it was a video of multiple different pages and it had that I just can't remember the video.
<p>Other than that I mainly go back to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> in case I forgot how to implement a certain tag whether it be image or a heading or a link.</p>
